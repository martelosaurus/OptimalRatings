This zip file contains three python scripts. The first, 'sandbox.py', is the file you should open first. It contains examples. The second, 'errors.py', implements an 'ErrorDistribution' class, which can be used to analyze the difference between the error of the discrete and identity message functions for various noise distributions. The third is a beta script. We are using this code to find 'optimal' message functions by solving a certain fixed point. This code is very much a work in progress, and is provided for transparency. As of the writing of this README, we have not used any output from this script in our paper.
